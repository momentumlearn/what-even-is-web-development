## Make a page about you.

1. Make a heading with your name.
2. Make a paragraph (write something interesting, like how to write your name in binary code... 😉).
3. Make an image element using the `img` tag. (Find an image you want to use in the `assets` folder. Click the copy button. That is what you will use as the `src` attribute for your link element.)
4. Add anything else you want to add!
